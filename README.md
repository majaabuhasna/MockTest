## INTRODUCTION

There are plenty of tram and bus lines in service in Kraków that help you get around the city and go beyond its limits (e.g. to Wieliczka). It often makes sense to give up the car for the sake of public transport, especially in the city centre.
Maps of city transport lines are available on the website of the Municipal Transport Facility (Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacyjne, MPK), and the timetables can be found on its website and at individual stops.

The same tickets apply throughout the city zone for all trams and buses, irrespective of line number. On the metropolitan bus lines (numbers starting with 2, 3, and 9) you can use the same tickets if you don’t intend to cross the city limits. Should you, however, intend to do so, you need a more expensive metropolitan (aglomeracyjny) ticket.

Tickets require validating (stamping) immediately on entering the tram or bus. Single fares and time-restricted tickets need to be stamped only once. The validity of time-restricted tickets can be determined from the last four digits on the printout from the ticket punch: this is the precise time when the ticket was validated.

## DATA
